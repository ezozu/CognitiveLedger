# CognitiveLedger: A Decentralized Knowledge Management System

CognitiveLedger is a Python-based project designed to create a decentralized, immutable, and verifiable knowledge management system. It leverages blockchain technology, specifically a simplified implementation mimicking distributed ledger principles, to ensure data integrity and provenance. The core goal is to provide a secure and transparent platform for storing, sharing, and validating information, making it suitable for applications requiring high levels of trust and accountability. Think of it as a knowledge repository where information authenticity is guaranteed through cryptographic hashing and distributed consensus (simulated within the application).

The project aims to address the challenges of data manipulation and information asymmetry prevalent in centralized knowledge systems. By implementing a distributed ledger, CognitiveLedger provides a tamper-proof record of all data entries and modifications. Each entry, representing a piece of knowledge, is linked to the previous entry through a cryptographic hash, forming a chain of records. This chain ensures that any alteration to a past entry would invalidate all subsequent entries, making data tampering immediately detectable. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of the ledger eliminates single points of failure and control, enhancing the system's resilience and security.

CognitiveLedger offers several key advantages, including increased data integrity, improved transparency, and enhanced security. It is particularly well-suited for applications where data authenticity is paramount, such as supply chain management, intellectual property protection, and academic research. The system provides a mechanism for verifying the origin and history of data, enabling users to trust the information they are accessing. The project is built using Python, making it easily extensible and adaptable to various use cases. It's designed with modularity in mind, allowing developers to integrate it into existing systems or build upon its core functionalities.

## Key Features

*   **Decentralized Ledger:** Implements a simplified blockchain structure to store knowledge entries. Each entry contains data (knowledge representation), a timestamp, and the hash of the previous entry. This ensures immutability and chronological ordering of information. The chain is maintained through a distributed (simulated) consensus mechanism.
*   **Cryptographic Hashing:** Employs SHA-256 hashing algorithm to generate unique fingerprints of each knowledge entry. This guarantees data integrity; any modification to the data will result in a different hash, making tampering detectable.
*   **Data Provenance Tracking:** Records the origin and history of each knowledge entry, including the author, timestamp, and any modifications made over time. This enables users to trace the lineage of information and verify its authenticity.
*   **Simplified Consensus Mechanism:** Utilizes a simple proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm (adjustable difficulty) to simulate a distributed consensus environment. This ensures that new knowledge entries are validated and added to the ledger in a secure and consistent manner. Note: This is a simplified simulation and not intended for production-level distributed systems.
*   **API for Data Interaction:** Provides a well-defined API for adding, retrieving, and querying knowledge entries. The API supports various data formats, including JSON and plain text, enabling seamless integration with other applications. The API also allows for searching the ledger based on keywords or metadata.
*   **Data Validation:** Implements basic data validation mechanisms to ensure that knowledge entries conform to predefined schemas. This helps maintain data consistency and quality within the ledger. This validation can be extended to support custom validation rules based on specific application requirements.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a modular architecture to facilitate extensibility and customization. Developers can easily add new features, such as different consensus algorithms or data storage mechanisms, without modifying the core codebase.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python 3.x:** The primary programming language used for building the CognitiveLedger system. Python's readability and extensive libraries make it ideal for rapid development and prototyping.
*   **Hashing Library (e.g., hashlib):** Used for generating cryptographic hashes of knowledge entries. Ensures data integrity and tamper-proof records.
*   **JSON Library:** Used for serializing and deserializing data for storage and API interactions. Provides a standardized format for data exchange.
*   **Flask (optional):** A lightweight web framework that can be used to create a RESTful API for accessing and managing the CognitiveLedger.
*   **sqlite3 (optional):** A lightweight database that can be used for persistent storage of the blockchain data.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/CognitiveLedger.git
    cd CognitiveLedger

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/macOS)
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat (Windows)

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4.  **Database setup (if using sqlite3):** This step might be optional depending on the implementation. Some implementations store the chain in memory, while others use a persistent database. If database usage is present, create the database file and configure it. Details would be present in the documentation within the repository.

## Configuration

CognitiveLedger can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file (e.g., `config.py`). The following environment variables are commonly used:

*   `DIFFICULTY`: Sets the difficulty level for the proof-of-work algorithm. Higher difficulty levels require more computational power to add new entries to the ledger. The default is set to 4.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: Specifies the URL of the database to be used for storing the blockchain data. If using sqlite, the URL would look something like `sqlite:///./cognitive_ledger.db`
*   `API_PORT`: Specifies the port on which the API will listen for incoming requests. The default port is 5000.

Example (setting environment variables in Linux/macOS):

export DIFFICULTY=5
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./cognitive_ledger.db
export API_PORT=8080

## Usage

Example usage (Assuming you have an API endpoint to add data):

First, make sure the main program is running, for example "python main.py".

Then, to add new data to the ledger:

import requests
import json

url = "http://localhost:5000/add_data" #replace localhost:5000 with your API endpoint

data = {"knowledge": "The sky is blue."}
headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}
response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers)

print(response.text)

To retrieve data:

import requests

url = "http://localhost:5000/get_data" #replace localhost:5000 with your API endpoint
response = requests.get(url)

print(response.text) #prints all the data in the ledger

(Note: Specific API endpoints and data structures may vary depending on the actual implementation. Refer to the project's documentation for detailed API specifications.)
